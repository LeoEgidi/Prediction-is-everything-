Temptative titles:  
Prediction isn't everything, but everything is prediction
Prediction is nothing without control

GENERAL IDEAS

- Statistics has always been thought as the "science of inference", or "science of the estimates", but rarely
 statisticians face the idea to validate their models on the ground of predictive accuracy (or prediction)
- Conversely, machine learning is the "science of the prediction", and rarrely machine learners try
 to explain how this predictive power has been gained.
- In terms of metaphors, the 'two-cultures' of Leo Breiman may be seen as follows:
    - statisticians are very elegant in using their guns, and they perfectly know how 
      to use them, how they are built, how much precision they may obtain
    - machine learners are very aggressive with their bazooka, they only have a 
      rough idea how they are built, they use them to 'kill the rabbit'.

COMMUNICATION DUTIES 

- Statisticians should remark the appealing idea of predictive accuracy based on uncertainty, such as the
posterior predictive distribution for future data. Point predictions are dangerous

SOME QUESTIONS, SOME TEMPTATIVE ANSWERS

  (a) Is the prediction part of a science design? 
  
      Using Bertrand Russel's words, I mean with science design the following scheme:

      1) hypothesis formulation
      2) Data collection
      3) Validation of the hypothesis through data
   
     In such a view, statistical science is deeply scientific and inductive. And according to this,
     prediction task is far away from the scientific practice.
     (I would say, that statistics may be seen as the 'skeleton of science')

  (b) Then, can we really state that machine learning procedures and Artificial Intelligence algorithms are valid and 
      good scientific tools only because they 'predict well'?
  
      Out-of-sample data are observable, not observed, so we should not truly trust the plausibility of our
      predictions, since they 'cannot fit the out-of-sample' data. Moreover, as Popper says, 'every scientific theory should
      be falsifiable': how could we falsify a theory if we do not have the data yet?

  (c) Is prediction useful in social science applications (presidential elections, economics measurements, political choices, etc.)?

      Karl Popper says that the idea of predicting social science events is often useless. However, produce predictions does not
      seem that we cannot do predictions.
