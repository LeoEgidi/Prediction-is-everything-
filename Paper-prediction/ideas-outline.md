Prediction isn't everything but everything is Prediction

I. Inferential statistics can be viewed through the lense of prediction.   
  - For statisticians, tension between explanation and prediction is not necessary (explanation can be viewed through perspective of prediction) 
  - Goal of Bayesian modeling should NOT be to find posterior, but rather to find posterior predictive distribution.   
  - Parameters don't exist, must connect to observables.   
  - Explanation through prediction.   
  - Model checking/development (post pred checks, but also prior pred checks).        

II. Practical examples (especially potential objections to our perspective).   
  - Hypothesis testing (Billheimer 2019 example).   
  - Ability estimation (e.g., IRT).   
  - Treatment effect estimation.   
  - Causal inference.   
  - What else?    

III. Discussion.   
  - Don't worry statisticians, we don't ONLY care about prediction
