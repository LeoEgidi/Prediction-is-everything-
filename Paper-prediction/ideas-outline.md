Prediction isn't everything but everything is Prediction

I. Goal of Bayesian modeling is NOT to find posterior, it's to find posterior predictive distribution
  - Parameters don't exist, must connect to observables
  - Explanation through prediction
  - Model checking/development (post pred checks, but also prior pred checks)
  - What else?

II. Practical examples (especially potential objections to our perspective)
  - Hypothesis testing (Billheimer 2019 example)
  - Ability estimation (e.g., IRT)
  - Treatment effect estimation
  - Causal inference
  - What else?

III. Discussion
  - Don't worry statisticians, we don't ONLY care about prediction
